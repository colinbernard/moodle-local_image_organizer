# Image Organizer  
Moodle Admin Tool which searches specified courses for images and moves them to a specified directory on the server.This tool was developed for WCLN because we moved to a new server and needed a way to download all images being used and transfer them to the new server.Allows several search settings including domains and URLs to ignore.
